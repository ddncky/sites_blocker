## Explanation and appreciations
During my studies, I sometimes got distracted by unnecessary websites in an unconscious search for cheap dopamine, so the idea of creating such an application came just in time. This project was written with a specific goal, which it continues to fulfill to this day. It is simple and easy to use. Thanks to its development, I have significantly advanced my understanding of Python and programming in general!

In this project, I also use a free API for Stoic quotes. I express my gratitude to the user [Stoic API](https://github.com/tlcheah2/stoic-quote-lambda-public-api) for this!
